There's an idea of a [[https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/some-lines-a-day-the-5-year-memory-book.html][5 year memory book]], laying out daily observations per
calendar day over five years. There's enough space for a few lines, and after
the book is filled with multiple years of entries it can be consulted to
identify recurrences. This is more or less trivial to do with a formatted
journal file, without space constraints.
