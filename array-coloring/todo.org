It was a very simple concept.

Because a lot of operators are overloaded, it can be hard to tell nouns,
monadic vs dyadic verbs, adverbs apart without actually parsing a line of k in
your mind.

In my dream, I came up with a simple idea. Instead of color-coding keywords,
can we have a simple parser that color-codes characters based on their
overloaded meaning?

Nouns be be one color, monadic verbs another, dyadic verbs another, etc. It
seems like such a simple way to disambiguate k primitives at a glance, and
probably wouldn’t be too hard to code in Sublime or VS Code.

Does anyone see any value in this? Or am I just not plugged into the matrix
properly?

I wouldn’t mind creating a GitHub repo for this if there is enough interest.
