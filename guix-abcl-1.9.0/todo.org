In ABCL, loading Guix libraries can be tricky. I found out that one cannot
override the packaged version of ASDF, and Guix does not patch it like it does
for other CL implementations.

I'd like to patch it at some point, but that probably involves moving the
definition next to the other Lisp stuff.

A global registry push, like Quicklisp does, works. But the new ASDF
configuration format is probably worth
learning. =$GUIX_ENVIRONMENT/share/common-lisp/systems= is the directory to
push, anyway.

#+begin_src common-lisp
  (asdf:initialize-source-registry
   `(:source-registry
     (:tree ,(merge-pathnames
              "share/common-lisp/source/"
              (concatenate 'string (ext:getenv "GUIX_ENVIRONMENT") "/")))
     :inherit-configuration))
#+end_src
